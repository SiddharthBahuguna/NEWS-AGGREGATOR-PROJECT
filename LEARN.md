<h1 id="4-System-Architecture">System Architecture</h1>

The News Aggregator Project is designed with a modular architecture that includes backend services, frontend interface, and database management.

### 4.1 Backend

The backend handles data processing, API integrations, and content aggregation. It includes services for fetching news articles, applying natural language processing (NLP) for categorization, and managing user interactions.

### 4.2 Frontend

The frontend provides a user interface for browsing and interacting with news content. It is designed to be intuitive and responsive, supporting various devices and screen sizes.

### 4.3 Database

The database stores aggregated news articles, user profiles, preferences, and interaction data. It uses relational database management systems (RDBMS) for structured data storage and retrieval.

<h1 id="5-Data-Processing-and-Organization">Data Processing and Organization</h1>

The project follows a structured approach to handle incoming news data, ensuring quality and relevance for users.

### 5.1 Data Crawling

News articles are crawled from designated websites and RSS feeds using automated scripts and APIs.

### 5.2 Data Cleaning

Incoming data undergoes cleaning processes to remove HTML tags, standardize formats, and ensure consistency.

### 5.3 Data Storage

Cleaned and organized data is stored in the database for efficient retrieval and display on the frontend.

<h1 id="6-User-Interface">User Interface</h1>

The user interface of the News Aggregator Project is designed to provide a seamless browsing experience. It features a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and interactive elements for enhanced user engagement.

<h1 id="7-Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

In conclusion, the News Aggregator Project aims to simplify access to news content from various sources through a unified platform.
